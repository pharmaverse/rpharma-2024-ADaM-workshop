# rpharma-phriday-workshop
Repo for the pharmaverse Friday workshop (First session - pharmaverse champion) at R/pharma 2023

In this repo you'll find:

- The slides used
- The exercised used
- The solutions used

Note that the renv.lock in this repo pertains to the environment the slides were built in and not then ones the exercises/solutions need.  
The best approach would be start Rstudio with R >= 4.3.1 and install the latest packages of:

- admiral
- pharmaversesdtm
- dplyr
- lubridate 
- stringr
